    abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Pixel Stream Editor. This forms the basis for an interactive synthesizer for designing highly realistic Computer Generated Imagery. The designer works in an interactive Very High Level programming environment which provides a very fast concept/implement/view iteration cycle.Naturalistic visual complexity is built up by composition of non-linear functions, as opposed to the more conventional texture mapping or growth model algorithms. Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal. The algorithms created with this paradigm are generally extremely fast, highly realistic, and asynchronously parallelizable at the pixel level.},

    abstract = {In this work the method of a single particle charge and mass measurement in electrodynamic Paul trap is proposed. In the experiments polydisperse Al2O3 particles were used. The measured masses were in the range from 1 × 10-8 to 9 × 10-8 g. The measured charges were in the range from 2 × 105 to 1.3 × 106 e.}
